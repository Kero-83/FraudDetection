# Fraud Dedetection Model (AI Course Project)

A fraud detection AI project involves developing an intelligent system that automatically identifies and prevents fraudulent activities. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the AI analyzes vast amounts of transaction data, detecting unusual patterns and behaviors indicative of fraud. The project typically includes building models that can recognize known fraud tactics (like identity theft or transaction anomalies), continuously learn from new data, and provide real-time alerts to reduce false positives and operational risks. It aims to enhance security, improve detection accuracy, and minimize financial losses for businesses and consumers.
